GIT BRANCH: Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line. 

    $ git branch feature        : creating a branch feature
    $ git switch feature        : for switching to feature
    $ git checkout feature      : for checkout to feature or switch to feature
    $ git switch -c test        : creates and switch to test
    $ git branch -d test        : deletes test branch


-----------------

GIT MERGE: Merging means that you have to merge that changes that you have made to the other branch to the main, resulting in bringing the code
