/*
Callback hell is basically the mess that is created when callbacks are subsequently passed to each other down the line one after another which ultimately results in lack of readability, maintainability and error handling.

Higher order function is basically a function that either taken a function as an argument or returns a function. 

function higherOrderFunction(callback){
    // do specific task

    callback();
    return;
}
