GIT STASH: stash is used to save the uncommitted changes to a temporary storage when you want to change the working branch or change context and don't want to unnecessarily create a commit.

    $ git stash         : in order to stash the changes
    $ git stash apply   : apply the top stash and reapply the changes
    $ git stash pop     : pop the top-most stach only if nothing is to be staged. It can lead to a conflict so, the operation is aborted
    $ git stash list    : getting all the stashed
    $ git stash -u      : also stashed untracked files
