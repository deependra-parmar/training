GIT DIFF: Git diff is used to see difference between two commits. 

    $ git diff <hash1> <hash2>

--------------------

GIT LOG: Used to list the log of the commits done till now. Contains SHA Code or commit code, Author, Date and commit message.

    $ git log 
    $ git log --oneline             : with short SHA, pointes and commit messages
    $ git shortlog                  : with just commit messages under user-name 
    $ git log --graph               : gives log in the form of timeline

--------------------

GIT REVERT: to revisit

--------------------

GIT STASH: stash is used to save the uncommitted changes to a temporary storage when you want to change the working branch or change context and don't want to unnecessarily create a commit.

    $ git stash         : in order to stash the changes
    $ git stash apply   : apply the top stash and reapply the changes
    $ git stash pop     : apply the top-most stash and pop the stash
    $ git stash drop    : drops the whole stash
    $ git stash list    : getting all the stashed
    $ git stash -u      : also stashed untracked files
