// Data-types in JS: 
//      1. Primitive Datatypes: Number, Null, Boolean, BigInt, String, Symbol, undefined
//      2. Non-Primitives: Functions, Arrays and objects

// Primitives are stored in the memory in the form of value, are not objects and doesn't have methods.
// Non-primitives are stored in the form of reference, are mutable, has methods and are objects.
